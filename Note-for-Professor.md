## Note to Professor

Dear Professor,

I wanted to inform you that I was unable to implement multithreading in this project because of technical limitations with my personal computer. Despite several attempts, the multithreaded version led to unexpected behavior and system instability, likely due to compatibility issues between the hardware and software. As a result, I opted for a single-threaded implementation to ensure the program functions reliably and correctly.

I recognize that multithreading was an important aspect of the project, but my priority was to deliver a solid solution that fulfills all other requirements. The current implementation effectively meets the core goals of text analysis and book comparison. Thank you for your understanding. 🙏🙏🙏
